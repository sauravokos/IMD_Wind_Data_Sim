# IMD_Wind_Data_Sim
Simulation of Wind Data into Point Vector representations over a satellite image

Fixed:-  
Show Image sets for different colours together (i.e. Overlapping).  

Added:-  
1) Class for choosing barb type, which is "BarbDef".  
2) Missing Wind Barb PNG Images in the respective folders for all colours.  

Bugs:- (Persistent)  
Show/Hide still not working.  

Bugs:- (New)  
On using "BarbDef" class to get the desired barb vector path, only last barb vector is showing for any colour. That is why current program is without using that.  

@natashagit please download and check the code. It runs now but bugs still present (See New Bugs)
