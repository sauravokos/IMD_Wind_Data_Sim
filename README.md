# IMD_Wind_Data_Sim
Simulation of Wind Data into Point Vector representations over a satellite image

Fixed:-
Show Image sets for different colours together (i.e. Overlapping).
Added:-
Class for choosing barb type which is "BarbDef".
Bugs:- (Persistent)
Show/Hide still not working.
Bugs:- (New)
On using "BarbDef" class to get the desired barb vector path, only last barb vector is showing for any colour. That is why current program is without using that.

@natasha please download and check the code. It runs now but bugs still present (See New Bugs)
